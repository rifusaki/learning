## rifusaki's (short) learning journey

here is some of the code i've wrote for my basic programming courses:

- PythonUM: based on the Python For Everyone book, dictated by UMich
- JavaDuke: dictated by Duke University along with engineering fundamentals
- CppUCSC: it actually includes both C and C++, by UCSC
